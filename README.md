# Simple Script for Network Diagnostics
1. Ask if the user wants to ping a predefined list of IP addresses or domain names (e.g., 8.8.8.8, google.com, your router IP, etc.) or if the user would like to enter the hostnames or IP addresses.
2. Stores the result of each ping (reachable/unreachable, time).
3. Logs the result with timestamp into a text file named ping_log.txt.

Includes basic error handling (e.g., if host is unreachable).
